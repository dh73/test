Abstract
========

Formal Verification uses mathematical techniques to exhaustively prove
that a property, or an obligation that must hold in a system, is proven
under all possible conditions or inputs of an RTL design. When this
property is falsified, a waveform or trace showing the sequence of
inputs leading to the violation is produced by the tool, but when no
violation occurs, the tool reports that a property is proven and no
further evidence of what trace leads to the proof of such assertion is
generated. Furthermore, assertions and assumptions are often composed of
a precondition (an expression that specifies when a property should be
checked) and a consequence (the condition that must hold for all
possible paths in the design). When the precondition is not triggered
for any reason, the assertion will pass vacuously [1]_.

This application note presents a methodology that uses two special cover
expressions, known as **weak precondition** and **witness** covers, that
can help to detect and debug false positives due vacuous results, as
well as a method to extract an evidence of a proven property in a form
of a waveform. First, we present scenarios where weak precondition
covers and witnesses can be employed to identify problems in the
**Formal Property Verification** (FPV) environment, and then we finalise
by showcasing some more difficult sequences using AMBA 5 CHI Link FSM
example and how this methodology helps to detect properties that are
passing successfully but are not sound.

Introduction
============

FPV proves that a property that describes the behaviour of a system,
usually described in **SystemVerilog Assertions** (SVA) or **Property
Specification Language** (PSL) in VHDL, holds in a circuit by
exhaustively searching in the design space using all possible inputs, a
sequence of values that leads to an state where the specified behavior
is violated. It then generates a **counterexample** (CEX) in the form of
a waveform or trace [2]_ that leads to failure. But, if the solver
cannot find a violation, the FPV tool reports that the property was
proven and no further evidence of what scenarios were tested to reach
that conclusion are generated.

One of the most common problems that happens to both experienced and
fresh engineers when working with FPV is when a number of properties are
passing vacuously and this result is not detected. Since the nature of
FPV is not generating evidence of the traces used to demonstrate the
conclusion that no assertion was violated, debugging vacuity can be a
difficult task. For example, sometimes the number of constraints causes
conflicts with the current suite of assertions. To solve this problem,
some heuristics can be used to identify which constraints are the
conflicting ones, and refine them, but this is a tedious task and
usually requires a good understanding of the design.

Vacuity is present in a design due numerous reasons, including:

-  The property does not correctly express the behavior to be proven.

   -  The semantics of the SVA property are different from what the design/verification engineer thought. That means, if the logic that fires an assertion never happens, then this assertion will always pass regardless of the logic that is supposed to be checked by the assertion.

-  The design does not exhibit the triggering behavior because the design is **overconstrained**, or in other words, the expected behaviour is restricted.

   -  Constraints limit the design states and generate conflicts to specified properties that are supposed to check such states if they are in the cone of influence of the assertion (see Figure 1.1).

| Figure 1.1. The restriction R1, represented as states grayed out,    |
| will make both assert statements A1 and A2 pass vacuously, since the |
| precondition (state C and state D) can never be true.                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Having a way to observe evidence of what the solver is taking as proof
of a property is also useful for the following reasons:

1. Provides guidance to verification engineers wanting to cover design behaviours.

2. Capturing a sequence of events that can be used to feed back into the RTL model by design engineers.

3. Ensure correct RTL implementation when no testbench is developed.

4. Increase confidence in the design by comparing a trace of a proven property with the semantics of the written assertion.

Both weak precondition and witness covers can be used to assist in the
task of avoiding false positives by refining vacuity as well [3]_, or
providing evidence of a trace that the solver uses as a proof of a
property. The following sections show how to use these special covers
and how to apply them.

Weak Precondition Cover
-----------------------

The weak precondition cover statement is shown in Figure 1.2. This cover
demonstrates that the precondition of a property can be covered, or can
evaluate to true, with the current set of constraints and the
configuration of the system\ *.* By adding an extra task to the SBY file
to add weak precondition covers of assertions, in **cover** mode, Tabby
CAD can validate if the result of the property is obtained from a valid
behavior if both *prove* and *cover* mode succeeded, or if there is a
discrepancy or vacuity if assertion passses but the weak precondition is
not reachable.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| precondition_cover: cover property(antecedent);                      |
|                                                                      |
| precondition_cover_delay: cover property(antecedent ##DELAY 1’b1).   |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.2. Weak precondition cover expressions. The                 |
| *precondition_cover* checks reachability of the antecedent, and the  |
| *precondition_cover_delay* checks the same but adds an extra delay   |
| to observe what happens in the following clock cycle. The 1’b1 after |
| the bounded delay will match anything after *antecedent* sequence    |
| match, and its main purpose is to help build valid syntax of the two |
| sequence concatenations used in here.                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The *precondition_cover* can be used to check that properties that use
implication operators can be proven non vacuously. The
*precondition_cover_delay* can be used for both properties that do not
use implication operator as well as properties that use it. The
unbounded delay ##DELAY can only be 1 if the property uses
non-overlapping implications, or 0 if the property uses overlapping
implications. For example, the weak precondition cover of the property
a0: s1 \|=> p1 and a1: s1 \|-> p1 in both precondition and precondition
with delay are:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| a0_precondition_cover: cover property(s1);                           |
|                                                                      |
| a0_precond_cover_delay: cover property(s1 ##1 1’b1);                 |
|                                                                      |
| a1_precondition_cover: cover property(s1);                           |
|                                                                      |
| a1_precond_cover_delay: cover property(s1 ##0 1’b1);                 |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.3. Assuming default clock and reset definition, the weak    |
| precondition cover of the expression a0. For a1, both precondition   |
| covers show the same trace as they are logically equivalent.         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The Figure 1.4 shows a waveform diagram of these cover statements 
and how they will look for this design.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|    :height: 3.27in                                                   |
|    :align: center                                                    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.4. The waveform shows that *precondition_cover_h0* reaches  |
| only the condition *s1* whereas *precondition_cover_delay_h0* adds   |
| an extra delay to capture the behavior at the next clock cycle.      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This cover does not add complexity to the design, and usually most FPV
tools extract by themselves this kind of cover expression. It is also
important to mention that for properties with nested implication, the
weak precondition is different since context may be needed as well to
derive the weak precondition covers.

It is also possible to use the weak precondition cover to verify that
the expression of a triggering assumption is reachable. For example, the
weak precondition cover of the assumption a1: assume property(en \|=>
!o_rst) is:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| precondition_cover: cover property(en);                              |
|                                                                      |
| precond_cover_delay: cover property(en ##1 1’b1);                    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.5. Using weak precondition cover as a guidance to avoid     |
| invalid constraints. In this example, without using the weak         |
| precondition cover, if the signal *en* is never true, the constraint |
| will be invalid. By using the weak precondition cover, this scenario |
| will be detected.                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Covering only the antecedent (like in *precondition_cover* syntax) is
the preferred precondition cover statement that most FPV tools use, and
the weak precondition cover with delay can be also used to visualize
behaviors at the next clock cycle of the overlapping implications. Most
of the situations where vacuity is the reason for passing properties can
be detected by using the weak precondition cover, however, there are
cases where this cover is reachable, but the proof can still pass
vacuously because of the weak semantics of the sequence property [4]_.
For these cases, the witness cover can detect such problems at the price
of adding a little complexity or computational overhead to the FPV tool.

Witness Cover
-------------

The witness cover is similar to the weak precondition cover but it adds
the consequent of the property to the cover expression. In this way,
Tabby CAD looks for a path where both triggering condition and effect of
the property can be seen. The generated waveform can be used as evidence
of a trace that the solver used to prove an assertion, or to make sure
the constrained behaviour can be seen in the design.

The witness cover expression of a triggering property (using implication
operator) is shown in Figure 1.6.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| witness_cover: cover property(antecedent ##DELAY consequent).        |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.6. The witness cover uses both the antecedent and           |
| consequent to find a path in the design where both are reachable.    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For example, the witness covers of the properties a0: property(s1 \|=>
p1), a1: property(s1 \|-> p1) and a2: property(s1) are:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| a0_witness_cover: cover property(s1 ##1 p1);                         |
|                                                                      |
| a1_witness_cover: cover property(s1 ##0 p1);                         |
|                                                                      |
| a2_witness_cover: cover property(s1);                                |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.7. Assuming default clock and reset definition, the witness |
| cover of the expression a0 and a1. Note that for a property that     |
| does not use the implication operator, covering the expression as in |
| *a2_witness_cover* generates a witness, not a weak precondition      |
| cover.                                                               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

It is important to note that the witness cover is not the removal of the
implication operation and the change of the assert statement to a cover
statement but a concatenation of the two sequences composed by the
antecedent and the consequent of a property. The implication operator in
a cover statement does not have defined semantics in the IEEE 1800-2012
LRM. The generated witness using this syntax is only one of the possible
traces the solver found as an evidence of validity, but it may not be
the only one.

Some tools will not extract this cover by default because the cover adds
extra overhead to the design and may not be desirable to have it enabled
all the time, or when certain scenarios do not benefit from witnessing
traces.

Methodology
===========

The general recommendation is to use both weak precondition covers and
witnesses in a mixed way. But, due to the nature of Tabby CAD separating
prove and cover modes, the witness covers can be used instead, to get a
stronger version of vacuity detection. The following section describes
where and how both precondition cover and witness can be employed to
increase confidence in FPV results.

Both weak precondition cover and witness, when reachable, can be used
to:

1. Eliminate scenarios of vacuous properties, thus avoiding false positives.

2. Debugging unreachable states, insufficient depth in BMC and root-cause an overconstrained set of assumptions.

3. Get evidence of proven behaviors, also to compare the traces with assertion semantics to identify semantic errors when defining properties.

4. Debug dead-ends and weak sequences that may have a vacuous suffix.

When these covers are not reachable, the following reasoning can be
derived:

1. Properties that passed with covers that are unreachable are not healthy.

   a. A property with successful status where the precondition or witness is unreachable, is vacuous and needs further analysis. The weak precondition and witness cover can be used to relax the constraints to a state where the conflict between assertions and assumptions is solved.

2. The FPV run can be stopped any time there are discrepancies between the covers and the asserts.

   a. For example, a regression system for large projects can be built, where if vacuity happens for a group of important properties, the run can be stopped and the engineering team can be informed immediately instead of wasting cycles for meaningless vacuous properties to converge.

   b. In any other environment, if an important number of constraints are used and the properties start to pass vacuously, the run can be stopped as well, since no conclusive result will be obtained from this run. Instead of having a false sensation of confidence and catching the problem in later flows due to vacuous results, the engineering team can improve the environment by debugging the constraints/settings and release an RTL with better QoR.

3. Assumptions can be checked by using both special covers.

   a. Conflicts between properties and assumptions, dead ends, fairness obligation and liveness property [5]_ loops can be checked using both special covers.

4. YosysHQ recommends using a mixed set of weak precondition covers and witnesses, but is inclined to the **witness** cover because it is stronger than the rest. For example, in designs with assertions with an important number or related constraints, witnesses can improve vacuity detection. For early RTL implementation or first FPV run, the weak precondition cover will not add high computation overhead. It is also suggested to incrementally move to witness cover to increase confidence of the current set of assertions and results.

A flow to apply weak precondition cover or witness is shown below.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.9. The Methodology flowchart. When the properties are       |
| passing and the witness covers (or weak precondition) are            |
| unreachable, the results are unsound and will need extra analysis.   |
| Without this cover, the verification or design engineer may take for |
| granted that the behaviour was proven when in reality this was not   |
| the case.                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Let’s consider three examples. First, consider what happens when design
assumptions prevent a state from becoming reachable. In Figure 1.10, we
have a design which accepts an 8-bit key as an input, and it asserts an
unlock signal once the key matches a certain programmed value. The
unlock signal can never be logic 1 in an FPV run, since the restrict_val
assumption constrains the solver to never consider values greater than
8’h83 for the key primary input.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+    |
| | always_ff @(posedge clk)      | restrict_val: assume property |    |
| | begin                         | (key < 8'h83);                |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | if (!rstn) unlock <= 1'b0;    | [...]                         |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | else                          | unlock_test: assert property  |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | if (key inside {8'b1?0??1?0}) | (key[7] && !key[5] && key[2]  |    |
| |                               | && !key[0] \|-> ##1 unlock);  |    |
| | unlock <= 1'b1;               |                               |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | end                           |                               |    |
| +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.10. In this example, for the unlock port to be asserted,    |
| the input key minimum value should be 8’h84, but the constraint      |
| restrict_val does not allow that value to be reached. The property   |
| will pass vacuously because that part of the logic was never         |
| activated. Execute **sby -f sandbox.sby example1** and the assertion |
| will pass.                                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Another example that involves logic and connectivity issues, such as
inverting pins or ports tied to constant values that block the testing
of some properties, can introduce errors that make properties pass
vacuously. In Figure 1.11, a default disable statement accidentally
prevents the delayed_reset assertion from being triggered.

| |                               | (!rstn \|-> ##2 delayed_rst); |    |
| +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 1.11. One of the most common mistakes that causes properties  |
| to pass vacuously is when the default disable cause restricts a      |
| variable to take the value defined in the property. In this example  |
| all properties are disabled when the system is in reset state (or    |
| when the rstn pin is low). But the property *delayed_reset*          |
| mistakenly uses the restricted value to check for a condition,       |
| making the assertion to pass vacuously. Execute **sby -f sandbox.sby |
| example2** and the assertion will pass.                              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, it’s possible that the solver just hasn’t had enough cycles to
reach a particular state needed to prove a property. For example, when
performing a Bounded Model Check (BMC), you might not have sufficient
depth configured. In Figure 1.12, the BMC depth is set with a value less
than the required to reach the expected maximum latency of an expected
behaviour of a property.

| Figure 1.12. If the bound for a BMC is less than the bound needed to |
| reach a useful state for proving the property, it will pass and      |
| might even leave a bug undetected. The witness cover is specially    |
| useful when performing BMC tests, making sure the property scenario  |
| is reachable with the current bound.                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Application of the Methodology
------------------------------

Reviewing the three prior examples, we can now illustrate how inserting
weak precondition and witness covers can help ensure proper assertion
status. In Figure 2.1 we insert either the weak precondition s_weak or
the witness s_witness, either of which ensures SBY reaches a state where
key >= 8’h84. Additionally, s_witness ensures that unlock will
subsequently hold. Observe how the only difference between s_weak and
s_witness is whether or not the expected consequent is part of the
property.

| |                               |                               |    |
| | if (!rstn) unlock <= 1'b0;    | [...]                         |    |

| | unlock <= 1'b1;               |                               |    |

| +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 2.1. Since the restrict_val constraint introduces a bug that  |
| causes the property to not trigger, the weak precondition s_weak and |
| witness s_witness will catch the error, resulting in an unreachable  |
| status. Execute **sby -f sandbox.sby witness1** and the witness will |
| show an unreachable status, flagging a vacuous result.               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In Figure 1.11, we saw how an accidental default disable statement can
render an otherwise reasonable assertion vacuous. In Figure 2.2, we
detect this situation with the witness s_witness.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| | always_ff @(posedge clk)      |                               |    |
| | begin                         | *default disable iff          |    |

| | else sreg <= {sreg[0], 1'b1}; | property                      |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | end                           | (!rstn \|-> ##2 delayed_rst); |    |
| |                               |                               |    |
| | assign delayed_rst = sreg[1]; | *s_witness: cover property    |    |
| |                               | (rstn ##2 delayed_rst);*      |    |
| +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+    |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 2.2. The s_witness witness will capture the problem of the    |
| inverted reset polarity in the property. Execute **sby -f            |
| sandbox.sby witness2** and the witness will show an unreachable      |
| status, flagging a vacuous result.                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For our final example, when the bound defined in the formal tool
configuration is less than the required by a property to be checked, the
result is inconclusive. Using witnesses helps to be sure that the
desired state is reachable with the current bound, and if not, flag it
as erroneous, so the engineer can increase the bound of the solver. It
is important to mention that the increase of the bound is derived
generally from analysis of latencies, study of micro-architecture, and
delays added by visiting possible interesting scenarios. But usually,
the depth is increased in magnitudes of 10 cycles.

In the next section, this methodology is employed to reveal possible
environmental issues by changing logic that the property does not
detect, yet still passes.

Case Study I - AXI4 Valid-Ready After Reset
-------------------------------------------

Consider the design in Figure 3.1. This is a simple AXI4 module with an
assertion that is proving the TVALID after reset rule. This assertion
passes even though an obvious error has been introduced.

As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the result of SBY is successful, although
the property is obviously incorrect.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The reason the proof fails is because first_point was set to 0
regardless of the state of ARESETn; therefore, TVALID_condition is never
triggered (it is vacuous) and it always passes regardless of the logic
driving TVALID_nxt.

We choose to use a witness to confirm the condition is being covered.
The following modifications are added to the design:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                      |

+======================================================================+
| Figure 3.4 Line TVALID_witness is introduced into the formal proof   |
| for this design. Execute sby -f axi_tvalid.sby witness and the       |
| witness cover will fail, successfully detecting the problem          |
| introduced in first_point logic.                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

From this example, an SBY recipe can be derived that adds an extra task
named **witness** to detect vacuous results. The Figure 3.5 shows this
SBY recipe.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

As explained before, the assertion will not trigger because it was
disabled by the bug, so even though the assertion passes, the witness
task can be launched to confirm the relevance of the assertion result.
If the witness check results in a negative (unreachable) answer, which
we see that it does in Figure 3.6, then there’s a problem that needs to
be fixed.

Case Study II - AMBA 5 CHI Link FSM

Consider the `AMBA 5
CHI <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0050/c>`__ FSM shown in
Figure 13-6 of Section “13.6.3 Expected transitions” that is shown
below. This expected state transition path is described in the AMBA 5
CHI specification as “Table 13-4 Stop/Stop to Run/Run state paths”.

The objective is to test a module that should accomplish the transition
shown in **Path 1** (see Figure 4.1). To achieve this goal, two modules
are provided to verify the expected path transition: A simple module
**test** that drives the input Tx/Rx pairs of the module
**amba5_chi_link_fsm**, a module that implements the AMBA 5 CHI link FSM
as shown in Figure 4.1. The architectural view of this example is shown
in Figure 4.2.

**Note:** The RTL of the **amba5_chi_link_fsm** is large, therefore is
not shown in the document. However, it is suggested to open the file and
analyse it while reading the next part of this appnote.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The following requirements needs to hold in the design:

1. A property that ensures that the design cannot transit to a banned output (shown in red boxes in the Figure 4.2).

2. A property that ensures that the **Path 1** shown in table 13-4 is reached correctly with the current sequence of inputs provided by the **test** module.

3. A property that ensures that the first transition (TxStop/RxStop -> TxStop/RxAct) is correct.

The Table 4.1 shows the encoding of such properties. Note how the
properties are using weak unbounded sequences (a ##[+] b).

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

As Figure 1.9 of Section Methodology suggests, further analysis is
needed to generate a conclusion and/or fix the problems in the RTL. The
following sections show how to debug the results obtained by the witness
cover.

Unreached Witness Analysis
--------------------------

After analysing the failure of property ap_banned_output: “A property
that ensures that the design cannot transition to a banned output (shown
in red boxes in the Figure 4.2)” with the witness cover, it can be seen
that a set of banned transitions are not yet implemented in the design.
This property can be enclosed in compiler directives to disable the
check until the logic for banned output transition is added, and then
the user can enable back the property.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| **wp_banned_output: cover property (initial_current_state ##[+]      |

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Debugging Unreached Witness
---------------------------

For the failure in the witness of the property ap_completed_path: “A
property that ensures that the path 1 shown in table 13-4 is reached
correctly with the current set of options”, the failure is a little more
complicated. This witness is not reachable, and the assertion is proven,
therefore there’s no information in this case of why this is failing.
Moreover, if the engineer used the weak precondition cover instead of
the witness, this problem would have been undetected making it more
difficult to debug.

To root-cause this scenario, the elegant solution is to convert the weak
sequence to a strong one, or opt to calculate the latency from the
initial state to some interesting point of the design and see what is
happening. In other words, by modifying the witness sequence, an
evidence of the design behaviour can be obtained. The problem can be
understood with this evidence.

The design takes 4 clock cycles to travel from s1 to stop. The witness
of the behaviour can be then encoded as follows:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| we_completed_path: cover property (initial_current_state ##4 1'b1);  |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 4.6. The initial_current_state sequence is concatenated to    |
| whatever comes after 5 clock cycles, to have evidence of the design  |
| behavior. The same method can be applied to extend traces obtained   |
| by the FPV tool, by increasing the cycles of the delay.              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The second witness shows that due the sum of all problems with
incorrectly driven inputs and the nature of the weak unbounded sequence,
the FSM can transition to an unexpected state as shown below:

+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------+
| **Current state**       | **Inputs**              | **Next state** |
+=========================+=========================+================+
| TxStop/RxStop (smt_step | All 0                   | TxStop/RxStop  |
| 0)                      |                         |                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------+
| TxStop/RxStop (smt_step | txlinkactivereq,        | TxAct/RxAct    |
| 1)                      | rxlinkactivereq =       |                |
|                         | 2’b11, rest 0           |                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------+
| TxAct/RxAct (smt_step   | txlinkactiveack = 1’b1, | TxRun/RxAct    |
| 2)                      | rest 0                  |                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------+
| TxRun/RxAct (smt_step   | All 0                   | TxRun/RxAct    |
| 3)                      |                         |                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------+

The following image helps to correlate with the table of above. This
trace is generated from the second witness we_completed_path.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

But if the precondition *current_state* is enabled and the consequent is
false, why did the property not fail?. Because the weak unbounded
sequence (##[+]) does not witness the inability of the precondition
*completed_path* to happen during the test (the test consists of four
states that cannot be expanded further, if no issue is witnessed during
all runs, a weak sequence results in a true value therefore not
falsifying the consequent).

The witness cover is a stronger version of the property
ap_completed_path as the consequent *completed_path* needs to be covered
in any of the reachable states of the model. For the property without
using a witness to be able to detect the unreached consequent, it should
use a strong unbounded sequence, but this will convert the property to a
liveness type. A suggested and simple approach to take instead is to
continue with the safety nature of the property, and analyse the
microarchitecture to define the expected delay instead of using the
unbounded version as done with we_completed_path. This is an example of
why using witness can help to debug complex issues.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ap_completed_path: assert property (initial_current_state \|-> ##4   |
| completed_path;                                                      |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 4.8. Refining the delay of the behavior needed for a          |
| property, to replace an unbounded sequence.                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

To fix this, the following modification to **s3** is needed, along with
solving the last problem presented by ap_completed_path witness.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| s3: begin {txlinkactiveack, rxlinkactivereq} = 2'b11; ns = s4; end   |
| // TxAct/RxRun                                                       |
+======================================================================+
| Figure 4.9. Part of the fix of this issue, there is still one        |
| problem to fix.                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For the unreached witness of ap_completed_path: “A property that ensures
that the first transition (TxStop/RxStop -> TxStop/RxAct) is correct”,
it is expected that rxlinkactivereq is asserted and txlinkactivereq is
deasserted in state s1 of the controller for the FSM to be able to
transition from TxStop/RxStop to TxStop/RxAct. Since the inputs are not
set, and the default values of unset inputs are 0 by the implementation,
the precondition of the property is equivalent to *initial_current_state
&& (1’b0 \|\| 1’b0),* which evaluates to 0, making this property pass
vacuously.

Final Remarks

-  For future releases of Yosys HQ, the weak precondition cover extraction will be done automatically, and the witness extraction will be possible to enable by default.

-  In this app note, all the assertions are **inlined**. In a future application note the assertions will be attached to a module using a **bind** SystemVerilog construct.

   A vacuous pass means that the property does not check the intended
   behavior and the tool will never find a violation regardless of the
   logic that drives this specific implementation.

.. [2]
   Some solvers or engines guarantee that the CEX found is the shortest
   possible, whereas other engines are aimed to reach deep states of the
   design usually hard to reach with conventional solvers. For example,
   bug hunting engines perform deep search in the design space to find
   CEXs that can be hundreds of cycles long. But usually, the FPV tool
   is configured with an engine that finds CEX of minimal length
   possible.

.. [3]
   A low formal coverage metric (such as mutation coverage) can mean
   that some properties have vacuous results (or are trivially proven).
   Coverage does not provide debug capabilities, it just shows that
   there exist some uncovered structures in the design that needs
   attention.

.. [4]
   “There are three forms of a sequence property: *sequence_expr*,
   **weak**\ \ \ *\ (sequence_expr)* and
   **strong**\ \ \ *\ (sequence_expr).* A **weak**\ \ (*sequence_expr*)
   sequence property evaluates to true if and only if, there is not a
   finite prefix that witnesses inability to match *sequence_expr”*.
   From IEEE 1800-2012, **Section 16.12.1 Sequence Property**.

.. [5]
   *Safety properties* are the prefered types of properties tested in
   FPV. They stipulate that something bad does not happen, and they have
   finite counterexamples because any path to a bad state is finite.
   Conversely, a *liveness property* stipulates that a good thing
   **eventually** happens, and they have infinite counterexamples. To
   check *liveness* properties, the tool must find finite cycles in the
   RTL model that do not satisfy the property, and usually a fairness
   obligation assumption is needed to help the tool during the
   *liveness* resolution. Is for this reason that *liveness* properties
   may not be efficient for FPV and they should be used when is
   absolutely necessary.
